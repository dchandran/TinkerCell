/**************************************************************************************/
This file contains the list of Python scripts that will automatically be loaded into TinkerCell.
Each line contains the following information, separated by a semi-color:

Each line appears as a button.
In addition to a button, each line can also appear as:
1) menu item
2) context menu item (mouse right click)
3) graphical tool button (TinkerCell's pop-up buttons)

Each line contains the following information; separated by a semi-color:

1) short description

2) Python file name (e.g. myprogram.py)

3) Category where to place the function followed by the function name.
   E.g. if your program is a simulation program, your would write Simulate::my simulation program.
   Spaces are allowed.
   Semi-colors are NOT allowed.

The rest are OPTIONAL:

4) Icon file
5) "menu" or "nomenu"
   Whether or not this function should appear in the menu (default = menu)
6) A family name, e.g. "gene" (case insensitive).
   When the mouse right button is pressed on an item of this family, this function will appear as an option.
7) "tool or "notool"
   When any item of this family is selected, this function will appear as an option. (default = notool)

Note: please leave a newline at the end of file
